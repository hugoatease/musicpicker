Web service that implements APIs, data storage and playback control for the MusicPicker project.

The web service offers a single place for someone to manage all his MusicPicker-enabled devices, and control what
music plays on each. It implements APIs, data storage and playback control.

This server application is a NodeJS rewrite of [MusicPickerService](https://github.com/hutopi/MusicPickerService/),
providing better performance and enhanced features. It aims to superseed the previous ASP.NET application and 
become the official MusicPicker server.
